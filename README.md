This is a small WebGL demo showcasing procedural waves with fresnel reflections, thus simulating a realistic water surface. It runs in all modern WebGL compatible browsers. The demo is written in Java and compiled to JavaScript using the [Google Web Toolkit](https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/) compiler.
